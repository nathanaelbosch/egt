# Master's Thesis Mathematics - Evolutionary Game Theory
Building on the paper ["Spatially Inhomogeneous Evolutionary Games"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04027) by Luigi Ambrosio, Massimo Fornasier, Marco Morandotti, Giuseppe Savar√©.


This is numerical implementation for some simple example game. The game is designed so that points hopefully converge to some (best-case global) minimum.


## Usage
